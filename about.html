        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>this short site is my personal project to keep a record of my book i am writing. interest and enquiries are welcome. as time 
            goes on, might post the book online and anyone is welcome to view it, make changes or whatever they like. 
        </p>
        <p>note, this is intended to keep records of the many characters in the book, nothing else. and maybe the plot and arcs within the 
            book. that is all.
